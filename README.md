# Enhancing Selection Efficiency: A Comparative Study of Cursor Techniques

## Project Overview

This project explores the efficiency and accuracy of selecting items in graphical user interfaces using three different cursor designs: the Standard Cursor, the Area Cursor, and the Bubble Cursor. The goal is to identify which cursor improves user performance in different interface conditions.

## Repo Structure

- `Main/`: Contains the Processing sketch files for running the experiment.
  - `Main.pde`: Main entry point for the sketch.
  - `Condition.pde`, `ConditionManager.pde`, `Point.pde`, `Rectangle.pde`, `Trial.pde`: Supporting classes for the experiment.
- `results/`: Contains CSV files in dated subfolders and a PDF of the survey responses.
- `plots/`: Contains generated plots visualizing the experiment results.
- `plot_results.py`: Python script for generating said plots.
- `PLOT.sh`: Shell script to set up a venv and run the plotting script.

## See UXCursor in Action

1. Run `Main.pde` in Processing.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the trials.
3. To generate the plots, run `./PLOT.sh` in the terminal.
4. Read our super detailed and thorough report for a comprehensive analysis of our findings.
